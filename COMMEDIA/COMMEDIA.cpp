    Idea : 
        - The idea is the same as the 2D Lloyd's puzzle. It is about the parity of the permutations.
        - You can see the cube as a 3D chessboard, to highlight the parity of the initial permutation
        - The initial position of the 0 cube in the puzzle allows us to calculate if reaching this permutations necessitated would have used an odd or even number of transpositions.
        - Then, by counting the length of each cycle in the initial  puzzle, we evaluate the signature of the initial permutation.
        - The puzzle is solvable if and only if this two informations are compatible
