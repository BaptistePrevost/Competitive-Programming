    Idea : 
        - The idea is the same as the 2D Lloyd's puzzle. It is about the parity of the permutations.
        - You can see the cube as a 3D chessboard with white and black boxes (even and odd), to highlight the parity of the initial permutation
        - In the initial permutation, we use the position of the empty cube (0) to calculate the number of moves (transpositions) necessary to reach this permutation from the base one.
        - The parity of this number is the signature of a reachable permutation with the empty cube located here. This signature is independant from the moves (=transpositions) we decided to perform to obtain a permutation from another.
        - Then, by counting the length of each cycle in the initial  puzzle, we evaluate the signature of the initial permutation.
        - The puzzle is solvable if and only if this two signatures are compatible.
