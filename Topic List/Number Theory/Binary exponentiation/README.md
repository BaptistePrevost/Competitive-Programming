# Idea

Calculate a^n in O(log(n))

# Applications
- Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number
(see [Matrix exponentiation](./../../Math/Matrix%20exponentiation/))
- Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers
- Applying a permutation k times
- Fast application of a set of geometric operations to a set of points
- Number of paths of length  in a graph
